# Athena
With my team, we tried to build an assistant that has some smart skills like Alexa and Google assistants. Mainly the project was an android application. And I developed RESTFUL API endpoints with Django (Web framework written in Python).
These endpoints were : 
Face recognition API which implements OpenCV’s  haar cascade for face detection and Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for face recognition.
Chatbot API which was a retrieval-based chatbot that answers the user questions from a corpus using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Cosine Similarity as a measure of similarity. The chatbot was able to analyse the sentiment of the user using Naive Bayes Classifier
and answer greeting and some other questions about itself using some predefined rules.
